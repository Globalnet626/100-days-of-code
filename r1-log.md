# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Miguel Silvino

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 14, Thursday, 2018].

## Log
## R0 - Random Code Challenges and programming concepts.
## R1 - Tetris Clone using FreeGlut + skeleton from my CS30 class with Solomon Russel
### R1D1 
Retooling FreGlut to make a Tetris clone. Currently understanding the framework to see what's possible and what's not.
I chose FreeGlut for i have experience in it during my Final in CS30 and I want to use an engine that forced me to do things from scratch.

### R1D2
Currently figuring out how to set scale in sprites. Figured out how to load files and what are the limits of what files I can load.
TODO: Figure out how to play music in the background.

### R1D3
Figured out setting scale of sprites and created a function that properly mapped X Y coordinates to fit the blocks. We can finally proceed with game logic as 
sprite manipulation is solid.
TODO: Figure out how to play music in the background.
TODO: Refactor some code and start thinking about optimizing the game logic.
TODO: Check out drawIce() in SpriteManager.H and maybe retool this to save on sprite usage.

### R1D4
Started work on the primitives and the tetromino blocks.
Created sprites for the active and the set blocks atm.
Might consider keeping color like the newer games but for now set blocks will have their own dulled out color.
