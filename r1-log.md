The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 14, Thursday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Retooling FreGlut to make a Tetris clone. Currently understanding the framework to see what's possible and what's not.
I chose FreeGlut for i have experience in it during my Final in CS30 and I want to use an engine that forced me to do things from scratch.

### R1D2
Currently figuring out how to set scale in sprites. Figured out how to load files and what are the limits of what files I can load.
TODO: Figure out how to play music in the background.
