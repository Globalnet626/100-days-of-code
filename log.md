**Today's Progress**: Retooling Freglut for Tetris and other projects

**Thoughts** This is a lot harder than i expected. The framework is a lot less malleable than I can percieve. SpriteManager needs to be rewritten if i want to use it 
for my purposes. Also might want to look into creating primatives instead. (IE making the boxes and the playing field procedurally instead of using a file).

1.) It's right here. I'll spin it off to its own repo sometime in the future.

**Today's Progress**: Attemtping to understand how FreeGlut draws sprites

**Thoughts** Finally understood that the original creator of the skeleton im using split the asset loading script into a different file, finally allowing me to load the images i need.
Now however, I need to understand how to figure out how the FreeGlut dictates skeletons as the current issue is that block loads properly at 0.25 HOWEVER that is way too small to use.
