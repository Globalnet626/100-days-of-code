# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Retooling Freglut for Tetris and other projects

**Thoughts** This is a lot harder than i expected. The framework is a lot less malleable than I can percieve. SpriteManager needs to be rewritten if i want to use it 
for my purposes. Also might want to look into creating primatives instead. (IE making the boxes and the playing field procedurally instead of using a file).

**Link(s) to work**
1.) It's right here. I'll spin it off to its own repo sometime in the future.
